Description:

We are creating Admin Tool that allows staff to manage web site content. One of the features  that needs to be implemented is managing images with tooltips.
Admin can upload image and add special pointer to it. By hover on this pointer - tooltip appears. Tooltip text and pointer position are customizable by admin.
Admin should be able to:

1) see list of all images;
2) see one image + tooltip on hover;
3) add new image with tooltip;
4) update selected image + tooltip text + tooltip position;
5) remove image;

Requirements:
- You should use one of the modern js frameworks;
- Markup should be simple but adaptive for mobile devices
- You should create custom functionality for handling tooltips on images, and not use already existing solutions
- Before implementing your solutions, provide an estimation and the list of technologies that you are going to use
- To save/load images you can use localStorage or 3rd-party services;

Bonus:
- emulate server interaction. All requests/responses have to be stubbed. It should be possible to unstub and change to real back-end.

Before you start, please provide a list of technologies you will use and an estimate (how long it will take you to complete the task).
